# Project Name

This project uses Vite, Tailwind CSS, and Radix UI.

## Setup and Running

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and configure as needed
4. Run the development server: `npm run dev`

## Additional Information

- `.env.example` includes a `USE_LOCAL_DATA` variable which, when set, uses initial data from [`src/context/data.ts`](./src/context/data.ts)
- PAPI (in `.papi` folder) was generated with `npm run papi add -w ws://localhost:9944 dev`
- PAPI methods can be modified in [`src/api/methods.ts`](./src/api/methods.ts)

## YOU ARE DONE - Go further if you like to experiment :)

If you do not like using `npm` but prefer to use any other manager (e.g. `pnpm`, `yarn`) you should:

- remove the directories `.papi` and `node_modules` and the `package-lock.json` file;
- remove the line `"@polkadot-api/descriptors": "file:.papi/descriptors",` from the dependencies section in the `package.json` file (this is autogenerated by the processes below in the next step);
- alter the commands as needed in the package.json `scripts` section (e.g. from `npm` to `yarn` or `pnpm` etc);
- make sure that the minimal-template node is running (follow the guidelines of the README file on the root);

and then (next step):

- install the dependencies (e.g. `yarn install`) (probably will end up with an error as `postinstall` cannot run - disregard for now);
- Run: `npx papi` - this will use the `./polkadot-api.json` and create the `.papi` directory (and the `"@polkadot-api/descriptors": "file:.papi/descriptors",` autogenerated line);
- Run: `npx papi add wsUrl -w ws://localhost:9944 dev` which will **download the metadata from your running local node** (and that is why it needs to be running) - and add them in the .papi directory.

Now you can work with your favourite package manager
